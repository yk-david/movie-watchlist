# Break down

## Step

1. Enter keyword
2. Click search button
3. Movie results appear

## Issue

- 2 types of search
  1. By Search, `s`: returns all matching -> find movie ID
  2. By ID or Title, `i` or `t`: returns only 1 matching --> accessing with movie ID
- Infos to be rendered are divided in either **1** or **2**, so I need to combine both
